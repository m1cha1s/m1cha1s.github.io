# PCB Badge project

I have started working on a small pcb badge based on rp2040 with 16MB of flash. I plan to make it run Circuitpython and have a built in airlift module based on esp32. It will also have a 4x4 led matrix driven with software by the rp2040. It is only a beggining but [here](https://github.com/m1cha1s/pcbBadgeRP2040) is a repo.
